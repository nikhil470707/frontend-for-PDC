# Frontend Software for PDC

A real-time data visualization application designed for **Phasor Data Concentrators (PDCs)** and **Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs)**.  
Built using **C++ (Qt 6 + QtCharts)**, it provides smooth and interactive visualization of streaming power system data with customizable controls.  

---

## Features
- Variable Selection Dropdown: Choose from 15+ data variables (phasor magnitudes, angles, frequency, ROCOF, analog values).  
- Adjustable Window Size: Control the time window for flexible visualization.  
- Real-Time Data Smoothing: Smooth curves using `QSplineSeries` for better readability.  
- Scrollable Time Window: Navigate historical data with auto-resume scrolling for live updates.  
- Split View: Compare two variables side by side using a dynamic split window.

## Technology Stack
- Programming Language: C++  
- Framework: Qt 6 (GUI + Widgets)  
- Charting Library: QtCharts (`QChartView`, `QSplineSeries`)  
- Installer: Qt Installer Framework (cross-platform executables)

### Running the Application
- Open the installed folder and run:  
  ```
  Find Frontend Software for PDC.exe
  ```
- Use dropdowns to select variables and adjust the time window.  
- Use scroll bar to navigate history, and split view to compare two variables.
